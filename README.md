Example Workflow
Below is a step-by-step example workflow demonstrating how a Garage Management System (GMS) in Salesforce streamlines operations from customer booking to service completion and follow-up.
Step 1: Customer Booking  
Action:  
A customer books a vehicle service appointment through:
Online customer portal.
Phone call or walk-in (entered manually by a customer support representative).
System Process:  
Salesforce Workflow:
The system automatically creates a Service Order linked to the customer and their vehicle record.
The customer receives a confirmation email or SMS with appointment details.
Inventory Check:
Salesforce Flow triggers a check on spare parts or tools needed for the job.
If stock is low, an alert is sent to the Inventory Manager to reorder.
 
Step 2: Job Scheduling  
Action:  
The Service Manager reviews the service order and assigns it to an available technician based on workload and expertise.
System Process:  
Job Assignment:
The system uses Salesforce Omni-Channel Routing to suggest technicians based on their skills and availability.
The technician receives a notification with job details, including vehicle information, customer notes, and tasks.
Calendar Update:
The service job is added to the technician's schedule.
Both the customer and technician receive reminders about the appointment.
 
Step 3: Service Execution  
Action:  
The technician performs the service, updating the system throughout the process.
System Process:  
Real-Time Updates:
The technician uses the Salesforce Mobile App to:
Mark the job as In Progress.
Log details of the service performed, parts used, and time spent.
Update the job status to Completed after finishing the service.
Customer Notification:
The customer receives an SMS or email update that the service.
Benefits of This Workflow  
Automation: Minimizes manual tasks and errors.

Efficiency: Ensures timely job completion and resource optimization.
Customer Satisfaction: Enhances trust and builds loyalty with seamless service and proactive communication.
Summary of Workflow:
The Garage Management System (GMS) in Salesforce integrates and automates garage operations, from booking to reporting, creating a seamless workflow that ensures efficiency, customer satisfaction, and business growth.
Detailed Steps to Solution Design
Salesforce Object Manager - Fields & Relationships Configuration
Context:
This screenshot shows the configuration of fields and relationships for the Customer Details object in Salesforce Object Manager. It highlights the custom fields and their respective data types, which are used to manage customer data effectively.
Description:
Fields Defined in the Object:
Appointment Date (Appointment_Date__c): A lookup field pointing to the Appointment object, used to associate customer records with their scheduled appointments.
Customer Name (Name): A text field with a maximum length of 80 characters, serving as the primary identifier for customer records.
Gmail (Gmail__c): An email field to store customer email addresses.
Phone Number (Phone_number__c): A phone field for recording customer contact numbers.
Created By (CreatedById): A standard lookup field pointing to the User object, indicating the user who created the record.
Last Modified By (LastModifiedById): A standard lookup field pointing to the User object, tracking the user who last modified the record.
Owner (OwnerId): A lookup field to User or Group, representing the owner of the record.












Salesforce Flow Builder - Update Records
Context: This screenshot illustrates a Record-Triggered Flow in Salesforce Flow Builder for updating records.
Description:
The Flow starts with a trigger, likely when a record is created or updated.
The highlighted element, "Update Records," is configured to update records with specific conditions:
The Condition: Payment_Status__c equals "Completed."
The Field to Update: Payment_Paid__c (its value is being dynamically set).
An error is displayed: The "Service_records__r" field doesn’t exist on the "Billing_details_and_feedback__c" object or you don’t have access to the field.
Relevance to the Project:
This showcases an example of automating data updates, such as payment processing or status tracking in the Garage Management System.
The issue suggests either a field access problem or incorrect object references in the flow configuration.






Salesforce Custom Report Type - Define Report Records Set
Context:
This screenshot illustrates the configuration process in Salesforce for defining report records in a custom report type. The report type is designed to include data from related objects, enabling advanced reporting capabilities for the Garage Management System.
Description:
Primary Object:
Customer Details is the central object of this report type, representing the starting point for data extraction.
Related Object Relationships:
Appointments (A to B Relationship):
Each Customer Details record must have at least one associated Appointments record.
Flexibility is allowed where a Customer Details record may or may not include associated Appointments.
Customer Details (B to C Relationship):
Each Appointments record must have at least one related Customer Details record (e.g., representing linked customer-specific details).
Service Records (C to D Relationship):
Each Customer Details record can relate to Service Records, representing services completed for the customer.
Object Limit Reached:
Salesforce restricts custom report types to a maximum of four related objects. As seen here, Customer Details, Appointments, and Service Records fill the allowed limit.

















Testing Approach for Garage Management System in Salesforce
1. Test Planning:
Define objectives, scope, and resources. Prepare a test plan and identify key modules (e.g., Customer Details, Appointments, Service Records, Payments).
2. Types of Testing:
Unit Testing: Validate Apex classes, triggers, and flows with at least 75% code coverage.
Functional Testing: Ensure system features like customer creation, appointment scheduling, and automation meet requirements.
Integration Testing: Test data flow between Salesforce and external systems.
Regression Testing: Revalidate existing functionalities after updates.
Performance Testing: Measure system performance under load (e.g., bulk data uploads, report generation).
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Involve end-users to confirm usability and requirements are met.
3. Test Case Development:
Write test cases for scenarios such as record creation, automation, and reporting. Example:
TC001: Verify new customer record creation.
TC002: Validate appointment scheduling.
4. Test Environment Setup:
Use Salesforce Sandbox to test with realistic data. Ensure proper user access for testers.
5. Test Execution:
Run test cases, track bugs, and collaborate with developers for fixes.
6. Automation (Optional):
Automate repetitive tests like regression using tools like Provar or Selenium.
7. Reporting and Post-Testing:
Maintain test reports, track defects, and conduct post-deployment testing in production to confirm functionality.
